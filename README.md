# Link Prediction using Graph Neural Networks

This project demonstrates a link prediction pipeline on social networks using lightweight GNN architectures (GraphSAGE and LightGCN). Built as part of a hands-on experiment, it shows how machine learning can model relationship formationâ€”and explain its recommendations with mutual-friend visuals.

We use a Facebook ego-network graph to train GNNs for link prediction. The model suggests new connections and explains its reasoning by highlighting shared friends.


## Business Application

This pipeline simulates real-world applications like:
- **Friend suggestions** in social platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn)
- **Team-matching** or **collaborator recommendations** in enterprise tools
- **Network-based outreach** in professional apps

## Pipeline Walkthrough

1. **Data Setup** 
2. **Model Definition**  *(see details below)*
3. **Training & Evaluation** 
4. **Explainability** 



   *Models*
     - **GraphSAGE**: Learns representations by aggregating local neighborhood info.
     - **LightGCN**: Lightweight alternative for efficient, deep collaborative filtering.


## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Install all required Python packages:
```bash
pip install torch torch_geometric scikit-learn
pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cu124.html
